# TF2Autobot (pricedb.io fork)

**[Join our Discord server here!](https://pricedb.io/discord)**

This is a fork of [TF2Autobot](https://github.com/idinium96/tf2autobot), with changes made to work and use [pricedb.io](https://pricedb.io) as the default pricing source after the shutdown of prices.tf.

## Requirements

-   Node.js 22.x or a newer LTS release

It keeps the core behaviour and setup flow of the original project, but:

-   Uses [pricedb.io](https://pricedb.io) as the default pricer.
-   Integrates the [pricedb.io](https://pricedb.io) Store API so backpack.tf sell listings can be mirrored to pricedb.io.
-   Integrates Mannco.store inventory, buy-order, and withdrawal workflows.

If you already know how to run TF2Autobot, you can treat this as a drop‑in replacement with the extra pricedb.io integration enabled.

## Getting started

All general installation and configuration steps are the same as TF2Autobot. Follow the new updated wiki below for:

-   [Setup & configuration](https://github.com/TF2-Price-DB/tf2autobot-pricedb/wiki)
-   [Environment variables](https://github.com/TF2-Price-DB/tf2autobot-pricedb/wiki/Configuring-the-bot)
-   [`options.json` reference](https://github.com/TF2-Price-DB/tf2autobot-pricedb/wiki/Configure-your-options.json-file)

### Global Disable for Chat Messages

After Valve started banning bots for sending messages it has been the recommendation that your bot doesnt send chat messages. To solve this a global block has been added which can be seen below. It is suggested to set your values to the below as a minimum however disabling commands is also suggested.

Configure in `options.json`:

```json
"globalDisable": {
    "messages": true,
    "greeting": true,
    "commands": false,
    "adminCommands": false
}
```

Look at the example [options.json](.example/options.json) for where this should go in the options file!

### Easy Copy Paste (ECP)

[Easy Copy Paste](https://github.com/TryHardDo/EasyCopyPaste) by [TryHardDo](https://github.com/TryHardDo/) has been integrated in this project. What this allows you to do is change you buy and sell commands to a much easier and user friendly format.

For example `!buy Burning Team Captain` becomes `buy_burning_team_captain` which is far easier to copy from listings. In order to add this to your listings you would update your buy and sell messages as per the below example.

```json
    "buy": "🔥 %price% 📦 Stock : %current_stock% / %max_stock%. 💬 Send %ecp_item%. 👉 Visit %pricedb_store% for my store!",
    "sell": "🔥 %price% 📦 Stock : %amount_trade% / %max_stock%. 💬 Send %ecp_item%. 👉 Visit %pricedb_store% for my store!",
```

-   `%price%` - displays the price (e.g., `14 keys`).
-   `%name%` - displays the **item name** or **itemID**.
-   `%ecp_item%` - displays the trading command (e.g., sell_Mann_Co_Supply_Crate_Key).
-   `%max_stock%` - displays the maximum capacity of the item in the bot's inventory.
-   `%current_stock%` - displays the current count of the item in the bot's inventory.
-   `%pricedb_store%` - displays the URL of the bot's PriceDB store.
-   `%pricedb_item%` - displays the URL of the item.

This results in listings like the below

![ECP](img/ecp_listings.png)

To set your ECP text to bold you would change the below in your `options.json`:

```json
"ecp": {
    "useBoldChars": true,
    "useWordSwap": true
}
```

Look at the example [options.json](.example/options.json) for where this should go in the options file!

### Pure Per Unit (PPU) Logic Updates

PPU has been reworked to handle stock counts of more than 1 item. This has been implemented through saving buys to a new queue working off FIFO (First in First out) logic. When a sale of an item is made the FIRST item in the queue dictates the lowest the sell price can fall before becoming frozen. The item will unfreeze if the sell raises above the first queued buy price again.

This results in items not being sold for a loss but can mean items are held during dips in item prices. This can be resolved by setting a timeout on top of the PPU settings to automatically revoke the PPU boundary in order to take the loss but move the item.

Configure in `options.json`:

```json
"partialPriceUpdate": {
    "enable": true,
    "thresholdInSeconds": 604800,
    "excludeSKU": [],
    "removeMaxRestriction": true,
    "maxProtectedUnits": -1,
    "minProfitScrap": 1,
    "stockGracePeriodSeconds": 3600
},
```

Look at the example [options.json](.example/options.json) for where this should go in the options file!

### Stats Command Improvements

If upgrading, rename your existing `polldata.json` to `polldata.old.json` otherwise historical data will skew !stats (optional)
The new stats system uses new logic to track profit by recording keys and metal separately to prevent point in time issues. These are used to provide estimated profit/loss with the !stats command. This change is backwards compatible with Autobot.

### crit.tf configuration

If you want to use crit.tf follow the below

1. **Environment variable**

    Set your pricedb.io Store API key in your process manager (PM2 ecosystem, Docker env, or system env):

    ```bash
    PRICEDB_STORE_API_KEY=your_pricedb_store_api_key_here
    ```

2. **`options.json` misc settings**

    In your `options.json`, under `miscSettings`, add or update:

    ```json
    "pricedbStore": {
      "enable": true,
      "enableInventoryRefresh": true
    }
    ```

    This enables the pricedb.io Store Manager and allows the bot to periodically refresh your pricedb.io inventory.

3. **Template variable for listings**

    You can include your pricedb.io store URL in your backpack.tf listing notes by using the `%pricedb_store%` template variable. The bot will automatically replace it with your friendly store URL (e.g., `https://crit.tf/sf/your-slug`).

    Example in your listing note:

    ```
    Visit my store: %pricedb_store%
    ```

After these changes, rebuild (if needed) and fully restart the bot so the new environment variable is picked up.

## Mannco.store configuration

Mannco.store is optional and is enabled only when both its API key and the `options.json` setting below are present. Create an API key in your [Mannco.store account settings](https://mannco.store/), then set it in your process environment:

```bash
MANNCO_STORE_API_KEY=your_mannco_store_api_key_here
```

The supplied [ecosystem template](template.ecosystem.json) already contains this variable. In `options.json`, enable the integration:

```json
"miscSettings": {
  "manncoStore": {
    "enable": true
  }
}
```

Mannco listings use USD cents from the bot pricelist: `sellUsd` is required to deposit/list an item and `buyUsd` is required to create a buy order. A value of `76` represents `$0.76`. Mannco deposits and withdrawals are matched to their Steam trades and accepted automatically.

### Mannco.store admin commands

All Mannco commands require the sender to be a bot admin and require admin commands to be enabled. Parameter values use `&`, and multiple asset IDs can be separated by commas or semicolons.

| Command                                                    | Description                                                                                                                     |

| `!mcostatus`                                               | Reconcile and display tracked deposits and withdrawals, including completed/failed Mannco trade status.                         |
| `!mcoresend tradeid=<Mannco trade id>`                     | Ask Mannco.store to resend an eligible trade.                                                                                   |
| `!mcobuy sku=<sku>&quantity=<quantity>`                    | Create or update a buy order using the pricelist USD buy price. `quantity` defaults to `1`.                                     |
| `!mcobuyorders [page=<number>]`                            | List active Mannco.store buy orders; page numbering starts at `0`.                                                              |
| `!mcobuyremove itemid=<Mannco item id>`                    | Remove an active Mannco.store buy order.                                                                                        |
| `!mcobalance`                                              | Show the Mannco.store balance.                                                                                                  |
| `!mcosales`                                                | Show the last week's Mannco.store sales summary.                                                                                |

Use `!mcolistings` to find Mannco asset IDs for `!mcoupdate` and `!mcowithdraw`. `!mcosell` and `!mcoupdate` require `confirm=true` because a matching Mannco buy order can sell the item immediately. See the [Mannco.store API documentation](https://docs.mannco.store/) for platform-level trade details.
